Look how I read outputs from the drake cache."
Drake notices that `small`, `coef_regression2_small`,
and `large` are dependencies of the
future compiled output report file target, `report.md`.
Just be sure that the workflow plan command for the target `'report.md'`
has an explicit call to `knit()`, something like `knit('report.Rmd')` or
`knitr::knit(input = 'report.Rmd', quiet = TRUE)`.

```{r example_chunk}
library(drake)
readd(small)
readd(coef_regression2_small)
loadd(large)
head(large)
```
