\arguments{
\item{plan}{workflow plan data frame.
A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
with a \code{target} column and a \code{command} column.
(See the details in the \code{\link[=drake_plan]{drake_plan()}} help file
for descriptions of the optional columns.)
Targets are the objects and files that drake generates,
and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.
Use the function \code{\link[=drake_plan]{drake_plan()}} to generate workflow plan
data frames easily, and see functions \code{\link[=plan_analyses]{plan_analyses()}},
\code{\link[=plan_summaries]{plan_summaries()}}, \code{\link[=evaluate_plan]{evaluate_plan()}},
\code{\link[=expand_plan]{expand_plan()}}, and \code{\link[=gather_plan]{gather_plan()}} for
easy ways to generate large workflow plan data frames.}

\item{targets}{character vector, names of targets to build.
Dependencies are built too. Together, the \code{plan} and
\code{targets} comprise the workflow network
(i.e. the \code{graph} argument).
Changing either will change the network.}

\item{envir}{environment to use. Defaults to the current
workspace, so you should not need to worry about this
most of the time. A deep copy of \code{envir} is made,
so you don't need to worry about your workspace being modified
by \code{make}. The deep copy inherits from the global environment.
Wherever necessary, objects and functions are imported
from \code{envir} and the global environment and
then reproducibly tracked as dependencies.}

\item{verbose}{logical or numeric, control printing to the console.
Use \code{pkgconfig} to set the default value of \code{verbose}
for your R session:
for example, \code{pkgconfig::set_config("drake::verbose" = 2)}.
\describe{
\item{0 or \code{FALSE}:}{print nothing.}
\item{1 or \code{TRUE}:}{print only targets to build.}
\item{2:}{in addition, print checks and cache info.}
\item{3:}{in addition, print any potentially missing items.}
\item{4:}{in addition, print imports. Full verbosity.}
}}

\item{hook}{function with at least one argument.
The hook is as a wrapper around the code that drake uses
to build a target (see the body of \code{drake:::build_in_hook()}).
Hooks can control the side effects of build behavior.
For example, to redirect output and error messages to text files,
you might use the built-in \code{\link[=silencer_hook]{silencer_hook()}}, as in
\code{make(my_plan, hook = silencer_hook)}.
The silencer hook is useful for distributed parallelism,
where the calling R process does not have control over all the
error and output streams. See also \code{\link[=output_sink_hook]{output_sink_hook()}}
and \code{\link[=message_sink_hook]{message_sink_hook()}}.
For your own custom hooks, treat the first argument as the code
that builds a target, and make sure this argument is actually evaluated.
Otherwise, the code will not run and none of your targets will build.
For example, \code{function(code){force(code)}} is a good hook
and \code{function(code){message("Avoiding the code")}} is a bad hook.}

\item{cache}{drake cache as created by \code{\link[=new_cache]{new_cache()}}.
See also \code{\link[=get_cache]{get_cache()}}, \code{\link[=this_cache]{this_cache()}},
and \code{\link[=recover_cache]{recover_cache()}}}

\item{fetch_cache}{character vector containing lines of code.
The purpose of this code is to fetch the \code{storr} cache
with a command like \code{\link[=storr_rds]{storr_rds()}} or \code{\link[=storr_dbi]{storr_dbi()}},
but customized. This feature is experimental. It will turn out
to be necessary if you are using both custom non-RDS caches
and distributed parallelism (\code{parallelism = "future_lapply"}
or \code{"Makefile"}) because the distributed R sessions
need to know how to load the cache.}

\item{parallelism}{character, type of parallelism to use.
To list the options, call \code{\link[=parallelism_choices]{parallelism_choices()}}.
For detailed explanations, see the
\href{https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/store.html}{high-performance computing chapter} # nolint
of the user manual.}

\item{jobs}{number of parallel processes or jobs to run.
See \code{\link[=max_useful_jobs]{max_useful_jobs()}} or \code{\link[=vis_drake_graph]{vis_drake_graph()}}
to help figure out what the number of jobs should be.
Windows users should not set \code{jobs > 1} if
\code{parallelism} is \code{"mclapply"} because
\code{\link[=mclapply]{mclapply()}} is based on forking. Windows users
who use \code{parallelism = "Makefile"} will need to
download and install Rtools.

Imports and targets are processed separately, and they usually
have different parallelism needs. To use at most 2 jobs at a time
for imports and at most 4 jobs at a time for targets, call
\code{make(..., jobs = c(imports = 2, targets = 4))}.

If \code{parallelism} is \code{"Makefile"},  Makefile-level parallelism is
only used for targets in your workflow plan data frame, not imports.  To
process imported objects and files, drake selects the best parallel backend
for your system and uses the number of jobs you give to the \code{jobs}
argument to \code{\link[=make]{make()}}. To use at most 2 jobs for imports and at
most 4 jobs for targets, run
\code{make(..., parallelism = "Makefile", jobs = c(imports = 2, targets = 4))} or
\code{make(..., parallelism = "Makefile", jobs = 2, args = "--jobs=4")}.}

\item{packages}{character vector packages to load, in the order
they should be loaded. Defaults to \code{rev(.packages())}, so you
should not usually need to set this manually. Just call
\code{\link[=library]{library()}} to load your packages before \code{make()}.
However, sometimes packages need to be strictly forced to load
in a certain order, especially if \code{parallelism} is
\code{"Makefile"}. To do this, do not use \code{\link[=library]{library()}}
or \code{\link[=require]{require()}} or \code{\link[=loadNamespace]{loadNamespace()}} or
\code{\link[=attachNamespace]{attachNamespace()}} to load any libraries beforehand.
Just list your packages in the \code{packages} argument in the order
you want them to be loaded.
If \code{parallelism} is \code{"mclapply"},
the necessary packages
are loaded once before any targets are built. If \code{parallelism} is
\code{"Makefile"}, the necessary packages are loaded once on
initialization and then once again for each target right
before that target is built.}

\item{prework}{character vector of lines of code to run
before build time. This code can be used to
load packages, set options, etc., although the packages in the
\code{packages} argument are loaded before any prework is done.
If \code{parallelism} is \code{"mclapply"}, the \code{prework}
is run once before any targets are built. If \code{parallelism} is
\code{"Makefile"}, the prework is run once on initialization
and then once again for each target right before that target is built.}

\item{prepend}{lines to prepend to the Makefile if \code{parallelism}
is \code{"Makefile"}. See the \href{https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/store.html}{high-performance computing guide} # nolint
to learn how to use \code{prepend}
to take advantage of multiple nodes of a supercomputer.}

\item{command}{character scalar, command to call the Makefile
generated for distributed computing.
Only applies when \code{parallelism} is \code{"Makefile"}.
Defaults to the usual \code{"make"}
(\code{\link[=default_Makefile_command]{default_Makefile_command()}}),
but it could also be
\code{"lsmake"} on supporting systems, for example.
\code{command} and \code{args} are executed via
\code{\link{system2}(command, args)} to run the Makefile.
If \code{args} has something like \code{"--jobs=2"}, or if
\code{jobs >= 2} and \code{args} is left alone, targets
will be distributed over independent parallel R sessions
wherever possible.}

\item{args}{command line arguments to call the Makefile for
distributed computing. For advanced users only. If set,
\code{jobs} and \code{verbose} are overwritten as they apply to the
Makefile.
\code{command} and \code{args} are executed via
\code{\link{system2}(command, args)} to run the Makefile.
If \code{args} has something like \code{"--jobs=2"}, or if
\code{jobs >= 2} and \code{args} is left alone, targets
will be distributed over independent parallel R sessions
wherever possible.}

\item{recipe_command}{Character scalar, command for the
Makefile recipe for each target.}

\item{timeout}{Seconds of overall time to allow before imposing
a timeout on a target. Passed to \code{R.utils::withTimeout()}.
Assign target-level timeout times with an optional \code{timeout}
column in \code{plan}.}

\item{cpu}{Seconds of cpu time to allow before imposing
a timeout on a target. Passed to \code{R.utils::withTimeout()}.
Assign target-level cpu timeout times with an optional \code{cpu}
column in \code{plan}.}

\item{elapsed}{Seconds of elapsed time to allow before imposing
a timeout on a target. Passed to \code{R.utils::withTimeout()}.
Assign target-level elapsed timeout times with an optional \code{elapsed}
column in \code{plan}.}

\item{retries}{Number of retries to execute if the target fails.
Assign target-level retries with an optional \code{retries}
column in \code{plan}.}

\item{force}{Force \code{make()} to build your targets even if some
about your setup is not quite right: for example, if you are using
a version of drake that is not back compatible with your project's cache.}

\item{log_progress}{logical, whether to log the progress
of individual targets as they are being built. Progress logging
creates a lot of little files in the cache, and it may make builds
a tiny bit slower. So you may see gains in storage efficiency
and speed with
\code{make(..., log_progress = FALSE)}. But be warned that
\code{\link[=progress]{progress()}} and \code{\link[=in_progress]{in_progress()}}
will no longer work if you do that.}

\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} object from the previous \code{make()}.
Supplying a pre-built graph could save time.
You can also get one from \code{\link{drake_config}(my_plan)$graph}.
Overrides \code{skip_imports}.}

\item{trigger}{Name of the trigger to apply to all targets.
Ignored if \code{plan} has a \code{trigger} column.
Must be in \code{\link[=triggers]{triggers()}}.
See \link{triggers} for explanations of the choices.}

\item{skip_targets}{logical, whether to skip building the targets
in \code{plan} and just import objects and files.}

\item{skip_imports}{logical, whether to totally neglect to
process the imports and jump straight to the targets. This can be useful
if your imports are massive and you just want to test your project,
but it is bad practice for reproducible data analysis.
This argument is overridden if you supply your own \code{graph} argument.}

\item{skip_safety_checks}{logical, whether to skip the safety checks
on your workflow. Use at your own peril.}

\item{lazy_load}{either a character vector or a logical. Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"eager"}: no lazy loading. The target is loaded right away
with \code{\link[=assign]{assign()}}.
\item \code{"promise"}: lazy loading with \code{\link[=delayedAssign]{delayedAssign()}}
\item \code{"bind"}: lazy loading with active bindings:
\code{\link[bindr:populate_env]{bindr::populate_env()}}.
\item \code{TRUE}: same as \code{"promise"}.
\item \code{FALSE}: same as \code{"eager"}.
}

\code{lazy_load} should not be \code{"promise"}
for \code{"parLapply"} parallelism combined with \code{jobs} greater than 1.
For local multi-session parallelism and lazy loading, try
\code{library(future); future::plan(multisession)} and then
\code{make(..., parallelism = "future_lapply", lazy_load = "bind")}.

If \code{lazy_load} is \code{"eager"},
drake prunes the execution environment before each target/stage,
removing all superfluous targets
and then loading any dependencies it will need for building.
In other words, drake prepares the environment in advance
and tries to be memory efficient.
If \code{lazy_load} is \code{"bind"} or \code{"promise"}, drake assigns
promises to load any dependencies at the last minute.
Lazy loading may be more memory efficient in some use cases, but
it may duplicate the loading of dependencies, costing time.}

\item{session_info}{logical, whether to save the \code{sessionInfo()}
to the cache. This behavior is recommended for serious \code{\link[=make]{make()}}s
for the sake of reproducibility. This argument only exists to
speed up tests. Apparently, \code{sessionInfo()} is a bottleneck
for small \code{\link[=make]{make()}}s.}

\item{cache_log_file}{Name of the cache log file to write.
If \code{TRUE}, the default file name is used (\code{drake_cache.log}).
If \code{NULL}, no file is written.
If activated, this option uses
\code{\link[=drake_cache_log_file]{drake_cache_log_file()}} to write a flat text file
to represent the state of the cache
(fingerprints of all the targets and imports).
If you put the log file under version control, your commit history
will give you an easy representation of how your results change
over time as the rest of your project changes. Hopefully,
this is a step in the right direction for data reproducibility.}

\item{seed}{integer, the root pseudo-random seed to use for your project.
To ensure reproducibility across different R sessions,
\code{set.seed()} and \code{.Random.seed} are ignored and have no affect on
\code{drake} workflows. Conversely, \code{make()} does not change \code{.Random.seed},
even when pseudo-random numbers are generated.

On the first call to \code{make()} or \code{drake_config()}, \code{drake}
uses the random number generator seed from the \code{seed} argument.
Here, if the \code{seed} is \code{NULL} (default), \code{drake} uses a \code{seed} of \code{0}.
On subsequent \code{make()}s for existing projects, the project's
cached seed will be used in order to ensure reproducibility.
Thus, the \code{seed} argument must either be \code{NULL} or the same
seed from the project's cache (usually the \code{.drake/} folder).
To reset the random number generator seed for a project,
use \code{clean(destroy = TRUE)}.}

\item{caching}{character string, only applies to \code{"future"} parallelism.
Can be either \code{"master"} or \code{"worker"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"master"}: Targets are built by remote workers and sent back to
the master process. Then, the master process saves them to the
cache (\code{config$cache}, usually a file system \code{storr}).
Appropriate if remote workers do not have access to the file system
of the calling R session. Targets are cached one at a time,
which may be slow in some situations.
\item \code{"worker"}: Remote workers not only build the targets, but also
save them to the cache. Here, caching happens in parallel.
However, remote workers need to have access to the file system
of the calling R session. Transferring target data across
a network can be slow.
}}

\item{keep_going}{logical, whether to still keep running \code{\link[=make]{make()}}
if targets fail.}

\item{session}{An optional \code{callr} function if you want to
build all your targets in a separate master session:
for example, \code{make(plan = my_plan, session = callr::r_vanilla)}.
Running \code{make()} in a clean, isolated
session can enhance reproducibility.
But be warned: if you do this, \code{\link[=make]{make()}} will take longer to start.
If \code{session} is \code{NULL} (default), then \code{\link[=make]{make()}} will just use
your current R session as the master session. This is slightly faster,
but it causes \code{\link[=make]{make()}} to populate your workspace/environment
with the last few targets it builds.}

\item{imports_only}{deprecated. Use \code{skip_targets} instead.}

\item{pruning_strategy}{Character scalar, either \code{"speed"} (default)
or \code{"memory"}. These are alternative approaches to how \code{drake}
keeps non-import dependencies in memory when it builds a target.
If \code{pruning_strategy} is \code{"memory"}, \code{drake} removes all targets
from memory (i.e. \code{config$envir}) except the direct dependencies
of the target is about to build. This is suitable for data so large
that the optimal strategy is to minimize memory consumption.
If \code{pruning_strategy} is \code{"speed"}, \code{drake} loads all the dependencies
and keeps in memory everything that will eventually be a
dependency of a downstream target. This strategy consumes more
memory, but does more to minimize the number of times data is
read from storage/disk.}

\item{makefile_path}{Path to the \code{Makefile} for
\code{make(parallelism = "Makefile")}. If you set this argument to a
non-default value, you are responsible for supplying this same
path to the \code{args} argument so \code{make} knows where to find it.
Example: \code{make(parallelism = "Makefile", makefile_path = ".drake/.makefile", command = "make", args = "--file=.drake/.makefile")} # nolint}

\item{console_log_file}{character scalar or \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}, console output will be printed
to the R console using \code{message()}.
Otherwise, \code{console_log_file} should be the name of a flat file.
Console output will be appended to that file.}

\item{ensure_workers}{logical, whether the master process
should wait for the workers to post before assigning them
targets. Should usually be \code{TRUE}. Set to \code{FALSE}
for \code{make(parallelism = "future_lapply", jobs = n)}
(\code{n > 1}) when combined with \code{future::plan(future::sequential)}.
This argument only applies to parallel computing with persistent workers
(\code{make(parallelism = x)}, where \code{x} could be \code{"mclapply"},
\code{"parLapply"}, or \code{"future_lapply"}).}

\item{protocol}{an environment with configuration info
on how to build the targets. You can supply a \code{protocol}
from a previous \code{config} with this argument.}
}
\value{
The master internal configuration list of a project.
}
\description{
This configuration list
is also required for functions such as \code{\link[=outdated]{outdated()}} and
\code{\link[=vis_drake_graph]{vis_drake_graph()}}. It is meant to be specific to
a single call to \code{\link[=make]{make()}}, and you should not modify
it by hand afterwards. If you later plan to call \code{\link[=make]{make()}}
with different arguments (especially \code{targets}),
you should refresh the config list with another call to
\code{\link[=drake_config]{drake_config()}}. For changes to the
\code{targets} argument
specifically, it is important to recompute the config list
to make sure the internal workflow network has all the targets you need.
Modifying the \code{targets} element afterwards will have no effect
and it could lead to false negative results from
\code{\link[=outdated]{outdated()}}
}
