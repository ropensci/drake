\title{Build/process a single target or import.}
\usage{
drake_build(target, config = NULL, meta = NULL,
  character_only = FALSE, envir = NULL, jobs = 1, replace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{name of the target}

\item{config}{internal configuration list}

\item{meta}{list of metadata that tell which
targets are up to date (from \code{\link[=drake_meta]{drake_meta()}}).}

\item{character_only}{logical, whether \code{name} should be treated
as a character or a symbol
(just like \code{character.only} in \code{\link[=library]{library()}}).}

\item{envir}{environment to load objects into. Defaults to the
calling environment (current workspace).}

\item{jobs}{number of parallel jobs for loading objects. On
non-Windows systems, the loading process for multiple objects
can be lightly parallelized via \code{parallel::mclapply()}.
just set jobs to be an integer greater than 1. On Windows,
\code{jobs} is automatically demoted to 1.}

\item{replace}{logical. If \code{FALSE},
items already in your environment
will not be replaced.}
}
\value{
The value of the target right after it is built.
}
\description{
Also load the target's dependencies beforehand.
