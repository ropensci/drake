\title{Declare output files and directories.}
\usage{
file_out(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Character vector, paths to files and directories.}
}
\value{
A character vector of declared output file or directory paths.
}
\description{
\code{file_out()} marks individual files
(and whole directories) that your targets create.
}
\details{
As of \code{drake} 7.4.0, \code{file_in()} and \code{file_out()} have
experimental support for URLs. If the file name begins with
"http://", "https://", or "ftp://", \code{\link[=make]{make()}} attempts
to check the ETag to see if the data changed from last time.
If no ETag can be found, \code{drake} simply uses the ETag
from last \code{\link[=make]{make()}} and registers the file as unchanged
(which prevents your workflow from breaking if you lose
internet access). If this approach to tracking remote data
does not work for you, consider a custom trigger:
\url{https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/triggers.html}.

# You can also work with entire directories this way.
# However, in `file_out("your_directory")`, the directory
# becomes an entire unit. Thus, `file_in("your_directory")`
# is more appropriate for subsequent steps than
# `file_in("your_directory/file_inside.txt")`.
