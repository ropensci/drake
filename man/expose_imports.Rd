\title{Expose all the imports in a package so \code{make()} can detect
all the package's nested functions.}
\usage{
expose_imports(package, character_only = FALSE, envir = parent.frame(),
  jobs = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{package}{name of the package, either a symbol or a string,
depending on \code{character_only}.}

\item{character_only}{logical, whether to interpret \code{package}
as a character string or a symbol (quoted vs unquoted).}

\item{envir}{environment to load the exposed package imports.
You will later pass this \code{envir} to \code{\link[=make]{make()}}.}

\item{jobs}{number of parallel jobs for the parallel processing
of the imports.}
}
\value{
The environment that the exposed imports are loaded into.
Defaults to your R workspace.
}
\description{
When \code{drake} analyzes the functions in your environment,
it understands that some of your functions
are nested inside other functions.
It dives into nested function after nested function in your environment
so that if an inner function changes, targets produced by the outer
functions will become out of date. However, \code{drake} stops searching
as soon as it sees a function from a package. This keeps projects
from being too brittle, but it is sometimes problematic.
You may want to strongly depend on a package's internals.
In fact, you may want to wrap your data analysis project itself
in a formal R package,
so you want all your functions to be reproducibly tracked.

To make all a package's functions available to be tracked
as dependencies, use the \code{expose_imports()} function.
See the examples in this help file for a demonstration.

# Suppose you have a workflow that uses the `digest()` function,
# which computes the hash of an object.

library(digest) # Has the digest() function.
g <- function(x) {
  digest(x)
}
f <- function(x) {
  g(x)
}
plan <- drake_plan(x = f(1))

# Here are the reproducibly tracked objects in the workflow.
config <- drake_config(plan)
tracked(config)

# But the digest() function has dependencies too.
head(deps_code(digest))

# Why doesn't `drake` import them? Because it knows `digest()`
# is from a package, and it doesn't usually dive into functions
# from packages. We need to call expose_imports() to expose
# a package's inner functions.

expose_imports(digest)
config <- drake_config(plan)
new_objects <- tracked(config)
head(new_objects, 10)
length(new_objects)

# Now when you call `make()`, `drake` will dive into `digest`
# to import dependencies.

cache <- storr::storr_environment() # just for examples
make(plan, cache = cache)
head(cached(cache = cache), 10)
length(cached(cache = cache))

# Why would you want to expose a whole package like this?
# Because you may want to wrap up your data science project
# as a formal R package. In that case, `expose_imports()`
# tells `drake` to reproducibly track all of your code,
# not just the exported API functions you mention in
# workflow plan commands.

# Note: if you use `digest::digest()`` instead of just `digest()`,
# `drake` does not dive into the function body anymore.
g <- function(x) {
  digest::digest(x) # Was previously just digest()
}
config <- drake_config(plan)
tracked(config)
})
}
