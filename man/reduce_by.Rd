\title{Reduce multiple groupings of targets}
\usage{
reduce_by(plan, ..., prefix = "target", begin = "", op = " + ",
  end = "", pairwise = TRUE, append = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{plan}{workflow plan data frame of prespecified targets}

\item{...}{Symbols, columns of \code{plan} to define target groupings
passed to \code{dplyr::group_by()}.
A \code{\link[=reduce_plan]{reduce_plan()}} call is applied for each grouping.
Groupings with all \code{NA}s in the selector variables are ignored.}

\item{prefix}{character, prefix for naming the new targets.
Suffixes are generated from the values of the columns
specified in \code{...}.}

\item{begin}{character, code to place at the beginning
of each step in the reduction}

\item{op}{binary operator to apply in the reduction}

\item{end}{character, code to place at the end
of each step in the reduction}

\item{pairwise}{logical, whether to create multiple
new targets, one for each pair/step in the reduction (\code{TRUE}),
or to do the reduction all in one command.}

\item{append}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the output will include the
original rows in the \code{plan} argument.
If \code{FALSE}, the output will only include the new
targets and commands.}
}
\value{
a workflow plan data frame
}
\description{
Perform several calls to \code{\link[=reduce_plan]{reduce_plan()}}
based on groupings from columns in the plan,
and then row-bind the new targets to the plan.
