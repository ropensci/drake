\title{Load the mtcars example.}
\usage{
load_mtcars_example(envir = parent.frame(), report_file = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{envir}{The environment to load the example into.
Defaults to your workspace.
For an insulated workspace,
set \code{envir = new.env(parent = globalenv())}.}

\item{report_file}{where to write the report file. Deprecated.
In a future release, the report file will always be
\code{report.Rmd} and will always be written to your
working directory (current default).}

\item{overwrite}{logical, whether to overwrite an
existing file \code{report.Rmd}}

\item{force}{deprecated}
}
\value{
Nothing.

\description{
Is there an association between
the weight and the fuel efficiency of cars?
To find out, we use the mtcars example from \code{drake_example("mtcars")}.
The mtcars dataset itself only has 32 rows,
so we generate two larger bootstrapped datasets
and then analyze them with regression models.
Finally, we summarize the regression models
to see if there is an association.
}
\details{
Use \code{drake_example("mtcars")} to get the code
for the mtcars example. The included R script is a detailed,
heavily-commented walkthrough. The chapter of the user manual at
\url{https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/mtcars.html} # nolint
also walks through the mtcars example.
This function also writes/overwrites
the file, \code{report.Rmd}.
