Title: A Pipeline Toolkit for Reproducible Computation at Scale
Description: A general-purpose computational engine for data analysis,
  drake rebuilds intermediate data objects when their dependencies change,
  and it skips work when the results are already up to date.
  Not every execution starts from scratch,
  there is native support for parallel and distributed computing,
  and completed projects have tangible evidence
  that they are reproducible.
  Extensive documentation, from beginner-friendly tutorials
  to practical examples and more, is available at the reference website
  <https://ropensci.github.io/drake/> and the online manual
  <https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/>.
