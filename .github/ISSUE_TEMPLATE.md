# Code of Conduct

You must obey this repository's [code of conduct](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/CONDUCT.md), as must everyone who responds to you on the issue tracker.

# Before posting

The GitHub issue tracker is mainly intended for bug reports and feature requests. While questions about usage etc. are also highly encouraged, you may alternatively wish to post to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and use the [`drake-r-package` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/drake-r-package).

Please search the [known issues](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues), both open and closed, including the [frequently-asked questions](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Frequently+Asked+Question%22). The articles on [cautionary notes and edge cases](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/articles/caution.html) and [debugging and testing drake projects](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/articles/debug.html) may also answer your questions.

When you post, please include a minimal reproducible example of the problem and/or desired behavior, if applicable. The [`reprex` package](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package is particularly nice for this.

Also, good style really helps others read the code you share. The [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) has suggestions, the [`styler` package](http://styler.r-lib.org/) is a great way to clean up your code automatically, and the [`lintr` package](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) checks for style issues.
