## Prework

- [ ] Read and abide by `drake`'s [code of conduct](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- [ ] Search for duplicates among the [existing issues](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues), both open and closed.
- [ ] If you think your issue has a quick and definite solution, consider posting to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) under the [`drake-r-package` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/drake-r-package). (If you anticipate extended follow-up and discussion, you are already in the right place!)

## Description

Describe the trouble clearly and concisely. 

## Reproducible example

Provide a minimal reproducible example with code and output that demonstrates the problem. The `reprex()` function from the [`reprex`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package is extremely helpful for this.

To help us read your code, please try to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The `style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.

## Desired result

What output or behavior do you want to see? Please be as specific as you can.

## Session info

End the reproducible example with a call to `sessionInfo()` in the same session (e.g. `reprex(si = TRUE)`) and include the output.
