This data analysis project explores some trends in R package downloads over time.
The data change often, and `drake` makes sure the project does not restart from scratch
on a typical runthrough. 

First, we load the required packages. `Drake` knows about the packages you install and load.

```{r pkgspkgs}
library(drake)
library(cranlogs)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```

We want to explore the daily downloads from these packages.

```{r packagelist}
package_list <- c(
  "knitr",
  "Rcpp",
  "ggplot2"
)
```

We plan to use the [cranlogs package](https://github.com/metacran/cranlogs).
The data frames `older` and `recent` will
contain the number of daily downloads for each package
from the RStudio CRAN mirror.

```{r datadataplan}
data_plan <- drake_plan(
  recent = cran_downloads(packages = package_list, when = "last-month"),
  older = cran_downloads(
    packages = package_list,
    from = "2016-11-01",
    to = "2016-12-01"
  ),
  strings_in_dots = "literals"
)

data_plan
```

We want to summarize each set of
download statistics a couple different ways.

```{r outputtypespackages}
output_types <- drake_plan(
  averages = make_my_table(dataset__),
  plot = make_my_plot(dataset__)
)

output_types
```


We need to define functions to summarize
and plot the data.

```{r summplotdatapackages}
make_my_table <- function(downloads){
  ddply(downloads, "package", function(package_downloads){
    data.frame(mean_downloads = mean(package_downloads$count))
  })
}

make_my_plot <- function(downloads){
  ggplot(downloads) +
    geom_line(aes(x = date, y = count, group = package, color = package))
}
```

Below, the targets `recent` and `older`
each take turns substituting the `dataset__` wildcard.
Thus, `output_plan` has four rows.

```{r outputplanpackages}
output_plan <- plan_analyses(
  plan = output_types,
  datasets = data_plan
)

output_plan
```

We plan to weave the results together
in a dynamic knitr report.

```{r reportplanpackages}
report_plan <- drake_plan(
  report.md = knit("report.Rmd", quiet = TRUE),
  file_targets = TRUE
)

report_plan
```

And we complete the workflow plan data frame by
concatenating the results together.
`Drake` analyzes the plan to figure out the dependency network,
so row order does not matter.


```{r packageswhole_plan}
whole_plan <- rbind(
  data_plan,
  output_plan,
  report_plan
)

whole_plan
```

The latest download data needs to be refreshed every day, so we use
triggers to force `recent` to always build.
For more on triggers, see the [vignette on debugging and testing](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/vignettes/debug.Rmd).
Instead of triggers, we could have just made `recent` a global variable
like `package_list` instead of a formal target.

```{r packagestriggers}
whole_plan$trigger <- "any" # default trigger
whole_plan$trigger[whole_plan$target == "recent"] <- "always"
```

Now, we run the project to download the data and analyze it.
The results will be summarized in the knitted report, `report.md`,
but you can also read the results directly from the cache.

```{r firstmakepackages, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}
make(whole_plan)

readd(averages_recent)

readd(averages_older)

readd(plot_recent)

readd(plot_older)
```

Because we used triggers, each `make()` rebuilds the `recent`
target to get the latest download numbers for today.
If the new data are the same as last time 
and nothing else changed,
drake skips the other targets.

```{r packagessecondmake}
make(whole_plan)
```

To visualize the build behavior, plot the dependency network.
Target `recent` and everything depending on it is always
out of date because of the `"always"` trigger.
If you rerun the project tomorrow,
the download counts will have been updated, so `make()`
will refresh `averages_recent`, `plot_recent`, and
`'report.md'`. Targets `averages_older` and `plot_older`
are unaffected, so `drake` will skip them.

```{r plotpackagesgraph, eval = FALSE}
config <- drake_config(whole_plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)
```
