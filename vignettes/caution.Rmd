```{r, echo = F}
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(drake)))
clean(destroy = TRUE)
```

With drake, there is room for error with respect to tracking dependencies, managing environments and workspaces, etc. For example, in some edge cases, it is possible to trick drake into ignoring dependencies. For the most up-to-date information on unhandled edge cases, please visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues), where you can submit your own bug reports as well. Be sure to search the closed issues too, especially if you are not using the most up-to-date development version. In this vignette, I will try to address some of the main issues to keep in mind for writing reproducible workflows safely.

## Your workspace is modified by default.

As of version 3.0.0, drake's execution environment is the user's workspace by default. As an upshot, the workspace is vulnerable to side-effects of `make()`. To protect your workspace, you may want to create a custom evaluation environment containing all your imported objects and then pass it to the envir argument of `make()`. Here is how.

```{r envir}
library(drake)
envir = new.env(parent = globalenv())
eval(expression({
  f = function(x){
    g(x) + 1
  }
  g = function(x){
    x + 1
  }
}), envir = envir)
myplan = plan(out = f(1:3))
make(myplan, envir = envir)
ls() # Check that your workspace did not change.
ls(envir) # Check your evaluation environment.
envir$out
readd(out)
```

## Commands are NOT perfectly flexible.

In your workflow plan data frame (produced by `plan()` and accepted by `make()`), your commands can usually be flexible R expressions.

```{r}
plan(target1 = 1 + 1 - sqrt(sqrt(3)), 
     target2 = my_function(web_scraped_data) %>% my_tidy)
```

However, please try to avoid formulas and function definitions in your commands. You may be able to get away with `plan(f = function(x){x + 1})` or `plan(f = y ~ x)` in some use cases, but be careful. Rather than using commands for this, it is better to define functions and formulas in your workspace before calling `make()`. (Alternatively, use the `envir` argument to `make()` to tightly control which imported functions are available.) Use the `check()` function to help screen and quality-control your workflow plan data frame, use `tracked()` to see the items that are reproducibly tracked, and use `plot_graph()` and `build_graph()` to see the dependency structure of your project.

## Minimize the side effects of your commands.

Consider the workflow plan data frame below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(drake)
```

```{r}
plan(list = c(a = "x <- 1; return(x)"))
```

Here, `x` is a mere side effect of the command, and it will not be reproducibly tracked. And if you add a proper target called `x` to the workflow plan data frame, the results of your analysis may not be correct. Side effects of commands can be unpredictable, so please try to minimize them. It is a good practice to write your commands as function calls. Nested function calls are okay.

## Do not change your working directory.

During the execution workflow of a drake project, please do not change your working directory (with `setwd()`, for example). At the very least, if you do change your working directory during a command in your workflow plan, please return to the original working directory before the command is completed. Drake relies on a hidden cache (the `.drake/` folder) at the root of your project, so navigating to a different folder may confuse drake.

## Directories (folders) are not reproducibly tracked.

Yes, you can declare a file target or input file by enclosing it in single quotes in your workflow plan data frame. But entire directories (i.e. folders) cannot yet be tracked this way. Tracking directories is a tricky problem, and lots of individual edge cases need to be ironed out before I can deliver a clean, reliable solution. Please see [issue 12](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues/12) for updates and a discussion.

## CHECK YOUR DEPENDENCIES

As the user, you should take responsibility for how the steps of your workflow are interconnected. This will affect which targets are built and which ones are skipped. There are several ways to explore the dependency relatoinsihp. 

```{r previewmyplan}
load_basic_example()
my_plan
```

```{r plotgraph}
plot_graph(my_plan, width = "100%", height = "500px") # Click, drag, and zoom to explore.
```

You can also check the dependencies of individual targets.

```{r checkdeps}
deps(reg2)
deps(my_plan$command[1]) # report.Rmd is single-quoted because it is a file dependency.
deps(my_plan$command[16])
```

List all the reproducibly-tracked objects and files, including imports and targets.

```{r tracked}
tracked(my_plan, targets = "small")
tracked(my_plan)
```

## Dependencies of imported functions

Suppose you import a function `myfun()` into your project

```r
globalvar = 1

g = function(x) {
  print(x)
}

myfun = function(x, y){
  g(globalvar)
  print(readLines('my_file.txt'))
  return(target_in_my_plan + x + y)
}

myplan = plan(
  a = 1,
  b = 2,
  target_in_my_plan = sqrt(5),
  result = myfun(a, b))
  
make(myplan)
```

The objects `globalvar`, `g()`, `myfun()`, `a`, `b`, `target_in_my_plan`, `sqrt()`, and `result` are reproducibly tracked. Additionally, `drake` knows that `myfun()` depends on `g()` and `globalvar`, `target_in_my_plan` depends on `sqrt()`, and `result` depends on `a` and `b`. However, the file `'my_file.txt'` is neither reproducibly tracked nor treated as a dependency of `myfun()`. To be tracked and treated as a dependency, `'my_file.txt'` must be mentioned in a formal command in `myplan`. In addition, `drake` does not know that `target_in_my_plan` is a dependency of `myfun()`. Formal targets declared in `myplan` must appear in other commands to be treated as dependencies, so the appearance of `target_in_my_plan` inside the body of `myfun()` is ignored.

## Dependencies are not tracked in some edge cases.

First of all, if you are ever unsure about what exactly is reproducibly tracked, use the `tracked()` function to list the names of all reproducibly tracked objects, functions, targets, files, etc. Alternatively, use `build_graph()` to obtain an [igraph](http://igraph.org/) object of the dependency structure of your workflow, and use `plot_graph()` to make a plot of the graph. And again, use the `check()` function to help screen and quality-control your project.

To look for dependencies, `drake` uses [codetools::findGlobals()](https://cran.r-project.org/package=codetools), which can be fooled. For example, suppose you define a custom function `f` in your workspace.

```r
f <- function(){
  b = get("x", envir = globalenv())
  digest::digest(1234)
}
```

When drake looks for the dependencies of `f`, it will fail to recognize the object `x` and the function `digest()`. Object `x` is referenced with quoted strings, not symbols, which tricks drake. The function `digest()` is referenced with the scoping rule `::`, so [codetools::findGlobals()](https://cran.r-project.org/package=codetools) does not detect it.

When it comes to commands in your workflow plan data frame, there are similar issues. It is possible to use double-quoted strings and the scoping operator `::` to trick drake into overlooking objects, functions, and files that should be dependencies. Use the `check()` function to scan the workflow plan for double-quoted strings and print out messages telling you where they occur.

## Compiled code is not reproducibly tracked.

Some R functions use `.Call()` to run compiled code in the backend. The R code in these functions is tracked, but not the compiled code called with `.Call()`.

## Parallel computing on Windows

On Windows, do not use `make(..., parallelism = "mclapply")`. Replace `"mclapply"` with one of the other `parallelism_choices()` or let `drake` choose the  `parallelism` for you. For `make(..., parallelism = "Makefile")`, Windows users need to download and install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).


## Proper Makefiles are not standalone.

The [Makefile](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) generated by `make(myplan, parallelism = "Makefile")` is not standalone. Do not run it outside of `drake::make()`. Drake uses dummy timestamp files to tell the [Makefile](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) what to do, and running `make` in the [terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/) will most likely give incorrect results.

```{r clean, echo = FALSE}
clean(destroy = TRUE)
unlink(c("report.Rmd", "Thumbs.db"))
```


## Makefile-level parallelism for imported objects and files

Makefile-level parallelism is only used for targets in your workflow plan data frame, not imports. To process imported objects and files, drake selects the best parallel backend for your system and uses the number of jobs you give to the `jobs` argument to `make()`. To use at most 2 jobs for imports and at most 4 jobs for targets, run

```r
make(..., parallelism = "Makefile", jobs = 2, args = "--jobs=4")
```
