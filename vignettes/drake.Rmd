# Data frames in R for [Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/)

Drake is a workflow manager and build system for

1. [Reproducibility](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch).
2. [High-performance computing](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=HighPerformanceComputing).

Organize your work in a data frame. Then `make()` it.

```r
> library(drake)
> load_basic_example() # Also (over)writes report.Rmd. `example_drake("basic")`, `vignette("quickstart")`.
> my_plan
                   target                                      command
1             'report.md'   my_knit('report.Rmd', report_dependencies)
2                   small                                  simulate(5)
3                   large                                 simulate(50)
4     report_dependencies      c(small, large, coef_regression2_small)
5       regression1_small                                  reg1(small)
6       regression1_large                                  reg1(large)
7       regression2_small                                  reg2(small)
8       regression2_large                                  reg2(large)
9  summ_regression1_small suppressWarnings(summary(regression1_small))
10 summ_regression1_large suppressWarnings(summary(regression1_large))
11 summ_regression2_small suppressWarnings(summary(regression2_small))
12 summ_regression2_large suppressWarnings(summary(regression2_large))
13 coef_regression1_small                      coef(regression1_small)
14 coef_regression1_large                      coef(regression1_large)
15 coef_regression2_small                      coef(regression2_small)
16 coef_regression2_large                      coef(regression2_large)
> make(my_plan)
```

# Installation

```r
install.packages("drake") # latest CRAN release
devtools::install_github("wlandau-lilly/drake@v3.1.0", build = TRUE) # latest GitHub release
devtools::install_github("wlandau-lilly/drake", build = TRUE) # development version
```

For `make(..., parallelism = "Makefile")`, Windows users need to download and install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

# Quickstart

```r
library(drake)
load_basic_example() # Also (over)writes report.Rmd. `example_drake("basic")`, `vignette("quickstart")`.
plot_graph(my_plan) # Graph the workflow.
outdated(my_plan) # Which targets need to be (re)built?
missed(my_plan) # Are you missing anything from your workspace?
check(my_plan) # Are you missing files? Is your workflow plan okay?
make(my_plan) # Run the workflow.
outdated(my_plan) # Everything is up to date.
plot_graph(my_plan) # The graph also shows what is up to date.
```

Dive deeper into the built-in examples.

```r
example_drake("basic") # Write the code files of the canonical tutorial.
examples_drake() # List the other examples.
vignette("quickstart") # Same as https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake/vignettes/quickstart.html
```

# Useful functions

Besides `make()`, here are some useful functions to learn about drake,

```r
load_basic_example()
drake_tip()
examples_drake()
example_drake()
```

set up your workflow plan,

```r
plan()
analyses()
summaries()
evaluate()
expand()
gather()
```

explore the dependency network,
```r
outdated()
missed()
plot_graph()
dataframes_graph()
render_graph()
read_graph()
deps()
tracked()
```

interact with the cache,
```r
clean()
cached()
imported()
built()
readd()
loadd()
find_project()
find_cache()
```

debug your work,
```r
check()

# Reproducibility 

There is room to improve the conversation and the landscape of reproducibility in the R and Statistics communities. At a more basic level than scientific replicability, literate programming, and version control, reproducibility carries an implicit promise that the alleged results of an analysis really do match the code. Drake helps keep this promise by tracking the relationships among the components of the analysis, a rare and effective approach that also saves time. 

```r
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
outdated(my_plan) # Which targets need to be (re)built?
make(my_plan) # Build what needs to be built.
outdated(my_plan) # Everything is up to date.
reg2 = function(d){ # Change one of your functions.
  d$x3 = d$x^3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
outdated(my_plan) # Some targets depend on reg2().
plot_graph(my_plan) # See how they fit in an interactive graph.
make(my_plan) # Rebuild just the outdated targets.
outdated(my_plan) # Everything is up to date again.
plot_graph(my_plan) # The colors changed in the graph.
```

# High-performance computing

Similarly to [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), drake arranges the intermediate steps of your workflow in a dependency web. This network is the key to drake's parallel computing. For example, consider the network graph of the basic example.

```{r basicgraph}
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
make(my_plan, jobs = 2, verbose = FALSE) # Parallelize over 2 jobs.
reg2 = function(d){ # Change a dependency.
  d$x3 = d$x^3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
plot_graph(my_plan, width = "100%") # Click, drag, and zoom.
```

When you call `make(my_plan, jobs = 4)`, the work proceeds in chronological order from left to right. The items are built or imported column by column in sequence, and up-to-date targets are skipped. Within each column, the targets/objects are all independent of each other conditional on the previous steps, so they are distributed over the 4 available parallel jobs/workers. Assuming the targets are rate-limiting (as opposed to imported objects), the next `make(..., jobs = 4)` should be faster than `make(..., jobs = 1)`, but it would be superfluous to use more than 4 jobs. 

See function `max_useful_jobs()` to suggest the number of jobs, taking into account which targets are already up to date. Try out the following in a fresh R session.

```r
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
plot_graph(my_plan) # Look at the graph to make sense of the output.
max_useful_jobs(my_plan) # 8
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "files") # 8
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "all") # 10
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "none") # 8
make(my_plan)
plot_graph(my_plan)
# Ignore the targets already built.
max_useful_jobs(my_plan) # 1
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "files") # 1
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "all") # 10
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "none") # 0
# Change a function so some targets are now out of date.
reg2 = function(d){
  d$x3 = d$x^3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
plot_graph(my_plan)
max_useful_jobs(my_plan) # 4
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "files") # 4
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "all") # 10
max_useful_jobs(my_plan, imports = "none") # 4
```

As for how the parallelism is implemented, you can choose from multiple built-in backends.

1. **mclapply**: low-overhead, light-weight. `make(..., parallelism = "mclapply", jobs = 2)` invokes `parallel::mclapply()` under the hood and distributes the work over at most two independent processes (set with `jobs`). Mclapply is an ideal choice for low-overhead single-node parallelism, but it does not work on Windows.
2. **parLapply**: medium-overhead, light-weight. `make(..., parallelism = "parLapply", jobs = 2)` invokes `parallel::mclapply()` under the hood. This option is similar to mclapply except that it works on Windows and costs a little extra time up front.
3. **Makefile**: high-overhead, heavy-duty. `make(..., parallelism = "Makefile", jobs = 2)` creates a proper [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to distribute the work over multiple independent R sessions. With custom settings, you can distribute the R sessions over different jobs/nodes on a cluster. See the [quickstart vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake/vignettes/quickstart.html) for more details.

# Acknowledgements and related work

The original idea of a time-saving reproducible build system extends back decades to [GNU Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/), which today helps [data scientists](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/15/make-for-data-scientists/) as well as the original user base of complied-language programmers. More recently, [Rich FitzJohn](http://richfitz.github.io/) created [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake), a breakthrough reimagining of [Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) for R and the most important inspiration for drake. Drake is a fresh reinterpretation of some of  [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)'s pioneering fundamental concepts, scaled up for computationally-demanding workflows. 

Thanks also to [Kirill M&uuml;ller](http://krlmlr.github.io/) and [Daniel Falster](http://danielfalster.com/). They contributed code patches and enhancement ideas to my [parallelRemake](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) and [remakeGenerator](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) packages, which I have now subsumed into drake.

In the sphere of reproducibility, drake and [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) are examples of non-literate programming tools (as opposed to literate programming tools such as [knitr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr)). Counterparts include [R.cache](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.cache), [archivist](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=archivist), [trackr](https://github.com/gmbecker/recordr), and [memoise](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memoise). See the [reporducible research CRAN task view](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch) for a more comprehensive list. Drake differentiates itself from these tools with its ability to track the relationships among cached objects and its extensive high-performance computing functionality.
