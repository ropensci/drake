# Learn about drake

The main resources to learn `drake` are

1. The [full manual](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/)
2. The [package website](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/)
3. [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr)'s [`drake` workshop from March 5, 2018](https://github.com/krlmlr/drake-sib-zurich).

## Cheat sheet

Thanks to [Kirill](https://github.com/krlmlr) for preparing a [`drake` cheat sheet](https://github.com/krlmlr/drake-sib-zurich/blob/master/cheat-sheet.pdf) for the [workshop](https://github.com/krlmlr/drake-sib-zurich).

## Frequently asked questions

The [FAQ page](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/faq.html) is an index of links to [appropriately-labeled issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22frequently+asked+question%22). To contribute, please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/new) and ask that it be labeled as a frequently asked question.

## Function reference

The [reference section](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/index.html) lists all the available functions. Here are the most important ones.

- `drake_plan()`: create a workflow data frame (like `my_plan`).
- `make()`: build your project.
- `loadd()`: load one or more built targets into your R session.
- `readd()`: read and return a built target.
- `drake_config()`: create a master configuration list for other user-side functions.
- `vis_drake_graph()`: show an interactive visual network representation of your workflow.
- `outdated()`: see which targets will be built in the next `make()`.
- `deps()`: check the dependencies of a command or function.
- `failed()`: list the targets that failed to build in the last `make()`.
- `diagnose()`: return the full context of a build, including errors, warnings, and messages.

## Tutorials

Thanks to [Kirill](https://github.com/krlmlr) for constructing two interactive [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials: [one supporting `drake` itself](https://krlmlr.shinyapps.io/cooking-drake-tutorial/), and a [prerequisite walkthrough](https://krlmlr.shinyapps.io/cooking-tutorial/) of the [`cooking` package](https://github.com/krlmlr/cooking).

## Examples

There are multiple `drake`-powered example projects [available here](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples), ranging from beginner-friendly stubs to demonstrations of high-performance computing. You can generate the files for a project with `drake_example()` (e.g. `drake_example("gsp")`), and you can list the available projects with `drake_examples()`. You can contribute your own example project with a [fork and pull request](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/pulls).

## Presentations

The talk broadly focused on tidy workflows and diversity in the R community.

## Real example projects

# Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [Jarad Niemi](http://www.jarad.me/), my advisor from [graduate school](http://stat.iastate.edu/), for first introducing me to the idea of [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for research. He originally set me down the path that led to `drake`.

Many thanks to [Julia Lowndes](https://github.com/jules32), [Ben Marwick](https://github.com/benmarwick), and [Peter Slaughter](https://github.com/gothub) for [reviewing drake for rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/156), and to [Maëlle Salmon](https://github.com/maelle) for such active involvement as the editor.
