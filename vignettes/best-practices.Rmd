```{r cautionstart, echo = F}
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(drake)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(magrittr)))
clean(destroy = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)

```

This vignette describes general best practices for creating, configuring, and running `drake` projects.

# Where to put your code

It is best to write your code as a bunch of functions. You can save those functions in R scripts and then `source()` them before doing anything else.

```{r sourcefunctions, eval = FALSE}
# Load functions get_data(), analyze_data, and summarize_results()
source("my_functions.R")
```

Then, set up your workflow plan data frame.

```{r storecode1}
good_plan <- drake_plan(
  my_data = get_data('data.csv'), # External files need to be in commands explicitly. # nolint
  my_analysis = analyze_data(my_data),
  my_summaries = summarize_results(my_data, my_analysis)
)

good_plan
```

`Drake` knows that `my_analysis` depends on `my_data` because `my_data` is an argument to `analyze_data()`, which is part of the command for `my_analysis`.

```{r visgood, eval = FALSE}
config <- drake_config(good_plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)
```

Now, you can call `make()` to build the targets.

```{r makestorecode, eval = FALSE}
make(good_plan)
```

If your commands are really long, just put them in larger functions. `Drake` analyzes imported functions for non-file dependencies.

## Remember: your commands are code chunks, not R scripts

Some people are accustomed to dividing their work into R scripts and then calling `source()` to run each step of the analysis. For example you might have the following files.

- `get_data.R`
- `analyze_data.R`
- `summarize_results.R`

If you migrate to `drake`, you may be tempted to set up a workflow plan like this.

```{r badsource}
bad_plan <- drake_plan(
  my_data = source('get_data.R'),           # nolint
  my_analysis = source('analyze_data.R'),   # nolint
  my_summaries = source('summarize_data.R') # nolint
)

bad_plan
```

But now, the dependency structure of your work is broken. Your R script files are dependencies, but since `my_data` is not mentioned in a function or command, `drake` does not know that `my_analysis` depends on it.

```{r visbad, eval = FALSE}
config <- drake_config(bad_plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)
```

Dangers:

1. In the first `make(bad_plan, jobs = 2)`, `drake` will try to build `my_data` and `my_analysis` at the same time even though `my_data` must finish before `my_analysis` begins.
2. `Drake` is oblivious to `data.csv` since it is not explicitly mentioned in a workflow plan command. So when `data.csv` changes, `make(bad_plan)` will not rebuild `my_data`.
3. `my_analysis` will not update when `my_data` changes.
4. The return value of `source()` is formatted counter-intuitively. If `source('get_data.R')` is the command for `my_data`, then `my_data` will always be a list with elements `"value"` and `"visible"`. In other words, `source('get_data.R')$value` is really what you want.

In addition, this `source()`-based approach is simply inconvenient. `Drake` rebuilds `my_data` every time `get_data.R` changes, even when those changes are just extra comments or blank lines. On the other hand, in the previous plan that uses `my_data = get_data()`, `drake` does not trigger rebuilds when comments or whitespace in `get_data()` are modified. `Drake` is R-focused, not file-focused. If you embrace this viewpoint, your work will be easier.

# R Markdown and knitr reports

`Drake` makes special exceptions for R Markdown reports and other [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) reports such as `*.Rmd` and `*.Rnw` files. Not every `drake` project needs them, but it is good practice to use them to summarize the final results of a project once all the other targets have already been built. The basic example, for instance, has an R Markdown report. `report.Rmd` is knitted to build `report.md`, which summarizes the final results.

```{r revisitbasic}
# Load all the functions and the workflow plan data frame, my_plan.
load_basic_example() # Get the code with drake_example("basic").
```

To see where `report.md` will be built, look to the right of the workflow graph.

```{r revisitbasicgraph, eval = FALSE}
config <- drake_config(my_plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)
```

`Drake` treats [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) report as a special cases. Whenever `drake` sees `knit()` or `render()` ([rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown)) mentioned in a command, it dives into the source file to look for dependencies. Consider `report.Rmd`, which you can view [here](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/inst/examples/basic/report.Rmd). When `drake` sees `readd(small)` in an active code chunk, it knows [report.Rmd](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/inst/examples/basic/report.Rmd) depends on the target called `small`, and it draws the appropriate arrow in the workflow graph above. And if `small` ever changes, `make(my_plan)` will re-process [report.Rmd](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/inst/examples/basic/report.Rmd) to produce the target file `report.md`.

[knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) reports are the only kind of file that `drake` analyzes for dependencies. It does not give R scripts the same special treatment.

```{r rmfiles_caution, echo = FALSE}
clean(destroy = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
file.remove()
unlink(
  c(
    "data.csv", "Makefile", "report.Rmd",
    "shell.sh", "STDIN.o*", "Thumbs.db"
  )
)
```
