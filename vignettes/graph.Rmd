`Drake` has powerful visuals to help you understand and plan your workflow. You can generate an interactive workflow plan graph with either `drake_graph()` or `vis_drake_graph()`. Then click, drag, hover, zoom, and pan. Use either the mouse or the green buttons near the bottom.


# Dependency reactivity

Initially, your entire project is out of date.

```{r graphoutdated}
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
vis_drake_graph(my_plan) # Same as drake_graph()
```

In the previous graph, all the targets were out of date. But after a `make()`, we will be all caught up, and the graph will show you.

```{r graphmake}
make(my_plan, jobs = 4, verbose = FALSE)
vis_drake_graph(my_plan)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/2211b300/images/built.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


But when you change a dependency, you throw some targets out of date until you call `make(my_plan)` again.

```{r reg2graphvisual}
reg2 <- function(d){
  d$x3 <- d$x ^ 3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
vis_drake_graph(my_plan)
```

width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"

# Subgraphs

Graphs can grow enormous for serious projects, so there are multiple ways to focus on a manageable subgraph. The most brute-force way is to just pick a manual `subset` of nodes to show. However, with the `subset` argument, `vis_drake_graph()` is prone to losing intermediate nodes and thus dropping edges.

```{r subsetgraph}
vis_drake_graph(my_plan, subset = c("regression2_small", "'report.md'"))
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/2211b300/images/subset.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

The other subgraph functionality is much better at preserving connectedness. Use `targets_only` to ignore the imports.

```{r targetsonly}
vis_drake_graph(my_plan, targets_only = TRUE)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/2211b300/images/targetsonly.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


Similarly, you can just show downstream nodes.

```{r fromout}
vis_drake_graph(my_plan, from = c("regression2_small", "regression2_large"))
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/2211b300/images/fromout.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


Or upstream ones.

```{r fromin}
vis_drake_graph(my_plan, from = "small", mode = "in")
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/2211b300/images/fromin.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

In fact, let's just take a small neighborhood around a target in both directions.


```{r fromall}
vis_drake_graph(my_plan, from = "small", mode = "all", order = 1)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/2211b300/images/fromall.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

The `report.md` node is drawn in somewhat, but it is still the farthest right in order to communicate `drake`'s parallel computing strategy. 

# Parallel computing laid bare

`Drake` shows its parallel computing strategy plainly in the graph.

When you call `make(my_plan, jobs = 4)`, the work proceeds in chronological order from left to right in the above graph. The items are built or imported column by column in sequence, and up-to-date targets are skipped. Within each column, the targets/objects are all independent of each other conditional on the previous steps, so they are distributed over the 4 available parallel jobs/workers. Assuming the targets are rate-limiting (as opposed to imported objects), the next `make(..., jobs = 4)` should be faster than `make(..., jobs = 1)`, but it would be superfluous to use more than 4 jobs.


# Finer control

We have only scratched the surface of `vis_drake_graph()`, there is much more functionality documented in the help file (`?vis_drake_graph`). In addition, `dataframes_graph()` outputs a list of nodes, edges, and legend nodes that you can modify and then feed right into your own [visNetwork graph](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/).
