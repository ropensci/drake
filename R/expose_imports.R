#' @title Expose all the imports in a package so `make()` can detect
#'   all the package's nested functions.
#' @description When `drake` analyzes the functions in your environment,
#'   it understands that some of your functions
#'   are nested inside other functions.
#'   It dives into nested function after nested function in your environment
#'   so that if an inner function changes, targets produced by the outer
#'   functions will become out of date. However, `drake` stops searching
#'   as soon as it sees a function from a package. This keeps projects
#'   from being too brittle, but it is sometimes problematic.
#'   You may want to strongly depend on a package's internals.
#'   In fact, you may want to wrap your data analysis project itself
#'   in a formal R package,
#'   so you want all your functions to be reproducibly tracked.
#'
#'   To make all a package's functions available to be tracked
#'   as dependencies, use the `expose_imports()` function.
#'   See the examples in this help file for a demonstration.
#'
#' @details Thanks to [Jasper Clarkberg](https://github.com/dapperjapper)
#'   for the idea that makes this function work.
#' @export
#' @return the environment that the exposed imports are loaded into.
#'   Defaults to your R workspace.
#' @param package name of the package, either a symbol or a string,
#'   depending on `character_only`.
#' @param character_only logical, whether to interpret `package`
#'   as a character string or a symbol (quoted vs unquoted).
#' @param envir environment to load the exposed package imports.
#'   You will later pass this `envir` to [make()].
#' @param jobs number of parallel jobs for the parallel processing
#'   of the imports.

#' head(deps(digest))
#'
#' # Why doesn't `drake` import them? Because it knows `digest()`
#' # is from a package, and it doesn't usually dive into functions
#' # from packages. We need to call expose_imports() to expose
#' # a package's inner functions.
#'
#' expose_imports(digest)
#' new_objects <- tracked(plan)
#' head(new_objects, 10)

#' # Now when you call `make()`, `drake` will dive into `digest`

#'
#' cache <- storr::storr_environment() # just for examples
#' make(plan, cache = cache)
#' head(cached(cache = cache), 10)
#' length(cached(cache = cache))
#'
#' # Why would you want to expose a whole package like this?
#' # Because you may want to wrap up your data science project
#' # as a formal R package. In that case, `expose_imports()`
#' # tells `drake` to reproducibly track all of your code,
#' # not just the exported API functions you mention in
#' # workflow plan commands.
#'
#' # Note: if you use `digest::digest()`` instead of just `digest()`,
#' # `drake` does not dive into the function body anymore.
