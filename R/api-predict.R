#' @param targets_only deprecated
#' @param jobs the `jobs` argument of your next planned

#'   to have running simultaneously?
#' @param known_times a named numeric vector with targets/imports
#'   as names and values as hypothetical runtimes in seconds.
#'   Use this argument to overwrite any of the existing build times
#'   or the `default_time`.

#' @param warn logical, whether to warn the user about

#'   `known_times` or [build_times()]. The times for these
