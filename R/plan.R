#' @title Function \code{plan}
#' @description Turns a named collection of command/target pairs into
#' a workflow plan data frame for \code{\link{make}} and
#' \code{\link{check}}.
#' @details A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
#' with a \code{target} column and a \code{command} column.
#' Targets are the objects and files that drake generates,
#' and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.
#'
#' For file inputs and targets, drake uses single quotes.
#' Double quotes are reserved for ordinary strings.
#' The distinction is important because drake thinks about
#' how files, objects, targets, etc. depend on each other.
#' Quotes in the \code{list} argument are left alone,
#' but R messes with quotes when it parses the freeform
#' arguments in \code{...}, so use the \code{strings_in_dots}
#' argument to control the quoting in \code{...}.
#' @seealso \code{link{check}}, \code{\link{make}},
#' @export
#' @return data frame of targets and command
#' @param ... commands named by the targets they generate.
#' Recall that drake uses single quotes to denote external files
#' and double-quoted strings as ordinary strings.
#' Use the \code{strings_in_dots} argument to control the
#' quoting in \code{...}.
#' @param list character vector of commands named
#' by the targets they generate.
#' @param file_targets logical. If \code{TRUE}, targets are single-quoted
#' to tell drake that these are external files that should be expected
#' as output in the next call to \code{\link{make}()}.
#' @param strings_in_dots character scalar. If \code{"filenames"},
#' all character strings in \code{...} will be treated as names of file
#' dependencies (single-quoted). If \code{"literals"}, all
#' character strings in \code{...} will be treated as ordinary
#' strings, not dependencies of any sort (double-quoted).
#' Because of R's automatic parsing/deparsing behavior,
#' strings in \code{...} cannot simply be left alone.
#' @examples
#' plan(small = simulate(5), large = simulate(50))
#' plan(list = c(x = "1 + 1", y = "sqrt(x)"))
#' plan(data = readRDS("my_data.rds"))
#' plan(my_file.rds = saveRDS(1+1, "my_file.rds"), file_targets = TRUE,
#'   strings_in_dots = "literals")

#' @title Function \code{as_file}
